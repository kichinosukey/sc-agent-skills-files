## Part 1: Updating the Marketing Skill

In the video, we updated the Marketing skill to use the BigQuery MCP server to get data from a BigQuery table instead of requiring a CSV file:

- [Prompts we used in this part](prompts.md#part-1-updating-the-marketing-skill)
- [Updated files of the Marketing skill we obtained during filming](updated_marketing_skill/analyzing-marketing-campaign/)

You can set up a BigQuery table to try this part (link to instructions below), or you can set up a local database instead. For example, you can set up a local SQLite database, import this [CSV file](campaign_performance_4weeks.csv) into the database, and use this [MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/sqlite). Or you can skip this part entirely.

- Optional alternative: [Instructions for setting up a SQLite table](additional_references/table_setup.md#sqlite-setup)

## Part 2: Creating the Brand Guidelines Skill

- [Brand guidelines files](brand_guidelines_files/)
- [Prompts we used in this part](prompts.md#part-2--creating-the-brand-guideline-skill)
- [Files of the skill obtained during filming](brand_guidelines_skill/craftedwell-brand/)

## Part 3: Implementing the Entire Workflow

- [Prompts we used in this part](prompts.md#part-3-implementing-the-entire-workflow)
- [Slides obtained during filming](output_report_example/CraftedWell_Weekly_Report_Dec16-22.pptx)

The slides might take a few minutes to generate, and they might look completely different from those in the video.
