In the first lesson, Claude AI used the Excel skill
0:02
to create spreadsheets displaying the marketing results.
0:06
The Excel skill is one of Anthropic's pre-built skills,
0:09
which also include a PowerPoint, Word, and PDF skill,
0:13
as well as a skill creation skill.
0:16
Let's take a look at those.
0:18
Now that we've seen how skills fit in the entire AI ecosystem,
0:21
let's take a look at some of the pre-built skills
0:24
that you can use out of the
0:27
box with Claude AI and Claude Desktop,
0:29
and that you can install yourself with tools like Claude Code.
0:32
Inside of this repository that lives at
0:35
github.com/anthropic/skills.
0:38
Let's take a look at the skills folder
0:40
and see which built-in ones that we have.
0:42
All of these are ready for production usage.
0:45
And we actually saw in a previous lesson
0:48
the use case of this Excel skill.
0:51
It's important to note that this list of skills,
0:53
while created at Anthropic,
0:55
is actually bucketed into two different sections.
0:58
The skills for Microsoft Docs, PDFs,
1:01
Power Points, and Excel
1:03
are known as document skills.
1:06
These are built in and always used
1:08
in tools like Claude AI.
1:10
The remainder of these skills are examples that we've created
1:13
that you can toggle on and off in Claude,
1:16
but by default with the exception of skill-creator
1:19
are toggled off.
1:20
Let's first start by analyzing the PowerPoint skill.
1:25
We can see just like other structures
1:27
that we have a SKILL.md file
1:30
as well as other files and folders to reference.
1:33
Inside of this SKILL.md,
1:36
we have that same YAML Frontmatter
1:39
that includes the name and the description.
1:41
What you're seeing here is how GitHub is rendering this markdown file,
1:46
but the underlying code
1:48
looks very similar to what we've made before.
1:51
You can view it this way if you're familiar with markdown files.
1:55
I'll switch back to the preview
1:56
because it looks a little bit nicer.
1:58
When we take a look at how
2:00
this skill works and what it does,
2:02
We've got an overview.
2:04
The users may ask to create,
2:06
edit, analyze contents of a PowerPoint file.
2:08
Here's what it looks like, here's how you read it.
2:11
And if there are particular tasks that need to be done,
2:14
there are underlying scripts to go ahead and execute.
2:18
Remember, these are not executed right out of the box.
2:22
These are only loaded and executed when necessary.
2:25
There's quite a bit that we can do with PowerPoint presentations,
2:28
colors, typography, as you can imagine,
2:31
this is how we can start to make things that look nicer
2:34
and look more like real-world presentations out of the box.
2:38
There are design principles that we have, requirements that are necessary,
2:42
and color palette selections that we can have Claude pick from
2:45
when the user does not specify them.
2:48
This SKILL.md is quite long,
2:50
as there is quite a bit
2:52
that we can do with PowerPoint presentations.
2:53
But what we're going to see later in this lesson
2:56
is how to actually use this skill
2:58
to take existing data and turn it into
3:00
a beautiful looking presentation.
3:03
The next skill I want to show you
3:05
is a little bit of a meta idea here,
3:07
and that's called the skill-creator.
3:09
And the skill creator is a skill
3:12
that serves the purpose of programmatically creating skills for you.
3:17
Instead of having to do things from scratch
3:19
and create the necessary files and folder structure,
3:22
the skill creator can do that for you.
3:25
Let's take a look at the SKILL.md file
3:27
and see what's happening here.
3:29
Similar to our other skills, we have a name and a description.
3:33
And I'm actually going to take
3:34
a look at the underlying code here,
3:35
since it's a little bit easier to follow.
3:38
We specify in this SKILL.md file
3:41
what skill is, what it provides,
3:44
and then we include some of the best practices associated with skills.
3:48
We're going to dive into those best practices in the next lesson.
3:52
But you can imagine when Claude is programmatically creating skills for you,
3:56
we want to leverage some of these best practices.
3:59
When we take a look at the skill creation process,
4:02
we're extremely explicit with the steps that we have here.
4:06
Since we want to use this skill to create a predictable workflow,
4:10
we want to be extremely explicit with what the steps are,
4:14
how to follow them, and what
4:16
to skip only if some reason exists.
4:19
We start with concrete examples,
4:21
we plan reusable skill contents,
4:23
and here you can start to see examples
4:26
that are very helpful for Claude to pattern match
4:29
when there's a skill you'd like to create.
4:32
When we start initializing the skill,
4:34
here we're running underlying Python scripts
4:37
to perform the task necessary.
4:39
Let's take a look at what those scripts do.
4:44
Inside of the scripts folder, I have three Python files here.
4:48
A script to initialize the skill and provide the underlying text,
4:53
a Python file to package that skill,
4:55
and then a script to validate that skill.
4:58
Let's take a look at what this
5:00
underlying code does to initialize a skill.
5:03
We take an existing template that we have
5:05
with some YAML Frontmatter and some placeholders and to-dos,
5:09
and we fill that in based
5:11
on the data that is coming in.
5:13
This underlying script allows us to create
5:16
the necessary text files when making our skills.
5:20
Once we've generated the necessary files, we can package that up.
5:24
Here you can see we're bringing in the necessary modules
5:27
to zip our skill necessary
5:29
and make sure that we're doing this
5:31
in the right folder and file structure.
5:33
Finally, we have one last script
5:35
to perform a validation of our skill.
5:38
make sure that a SKILL.md exists,
5:41
validate some of the YAML Frontmatter,
5:43
and make sure that what we put
5:45
inside of our folder and files is correct.
5:49
We're going to be leveraging this skill-creator skill
5:52
to take existing content that we have
5:54
and package it up into a reusable and modular script.
5:58
Now let's go ahead and shift gears back to Claude
6:01
and see how to put together built-in skills,
6:03
our own skills, and a predictable workflow
6:05
with an MCP server.
6:08
Back in Claude, let's go and take a look
6:11
and make sure that we have the
6:13
correct skills enabled and where those live.
6:16
Back in settings, inside of capabilities.
6:19
We saw previously, we can create skills in this section.
6:23
What I want to show you
6:24
are the example skills that we have
6:27
and this should look pretty familiar.
6:28
This is what we saw on GitHub.
6:30
By default, these skills are turned off.
6:33
If we want to toggle them on, we can absolutely do so.
6:36
The skill that is toggled on by default
6:39
is the skill-creator that we just saw.
6:42
It's important to note that while the skill-creator
6:44
is extremely effective at creating
6:47
underlying skills and structure necessary,
6:50
we still have to be intentional about the prompt that we provide
6:53
and the data that goes in to
6:55
the skill that we're going to make.
6:57
What we're going to do now is
6:59
put all of these ideas around skills,
7:02
MCP, and prompting together.
7:05
First, we're going to modify our previous skill
7:08
that we created for analyzing campaigns.
7:11
to not use a CSV for data, but instead BigQuery.
7:16
If you're not familiar, BigQuery is a data store powered by Google,
7:20
and in order to bring in the
7:22
necessary tooling and context to work with BigQuery,
7:25
we're going to connect an MCP server.
7:27
So we're going to use the skill-creator skill
7:30
to modify our previous marketing analyzing skill to use BigQuery.
7:35
We're then going to use skill-creator to create another skill.
7:39
This will be for the purpose of brand guidelines.
7:42
We'll include a file that specifies the guidelines as well as logos,
7:47
and we'll build for ourselves another skill
7:50
to perform that task. Finally,
7:52
we'll take our two skills that we used
7:55
to extract and analyze data and to leverage brand guidelines
7:59
and combine them with a built-in skill
8:02
for creating PowerPoint presentations
8:04
to create a workflow that makes use of prompting,
8:07
skills, and the model context protocol.
8:09
Before we jump in, you might be wondering
8:12
where the Excel and PowerPoint
8:14
and other document skills that we saw before live.
8:18
These are built in to Claude AI.
8:20
and are not things that can be toggled on and off.
8:23
So with that in mind, let's start this workflow.
8:26
Before we modify our analyzing marketing campaign skill to use BigQuery,
8:31
Let's also make a note that we're using Claude desktop here
8:35
to connect to a local MCP server to leverage BigQuery.
8:39
So let's take a look at how that BigQuery server is configured.
8:43
I'm going to head over to Settings, Developer
8:46
And here, we can take a look
8:49
at the underlying command and arguments
8:51
and environment variables for the particular project
8:53
and where my credentials live.
8:56
For this example, we don't have to use BigQuery,
8:59
you can use a database, some external data store,
9:02
but we just want to showcase what it looks like
9:04
with skills and MCP servers working together.
9:07
And if you're interested in seeing that
9:10
underlying config file, here's what it looks like.
9:13
In this config file, we specify
9:14
the servers we want to connect to
9:17
and the underlying commands to run when Claude Desktop starts.
9:21
With that in mind, let's go ahead and modify
9:24
our previous skill to now use BigQuery
9:27
instead of CSVs for data access.
9:31
To make sure this is working correctly, let's first ask Claude
9:35
to list the tables in BigQuery that exist.
9:42
This is going to make use
9:43
of the MCP server that we have.
9:45
We're going to allow this and we
9:47
should get back the list of tables.
9:49
In this case, we only have one.
9:53
So here we can see there's a data set called marketing
9:55
that contains a single table.
9:57
Now we're going to ask Claude
9:59
to show me the schema of the table.
10:04
Hopefully Claude can pick up that small spelling mistake
10:07
and we should be in business. Here
10:10
we're specifying what the table looks like.
10:13
And this looks great. And we're
10:14
going to make use of this schema
10:16
when we go ahead and update our analyzing-marketing-campaign skill.
10:21
What we're going to do now is ask Claude to update
10:24
our analyzing-marketing-campaign skill
10:26
so that instead of a CSV upload, we pull from BigQuery.
10:30
We specify the data
10:32
from the BigQuery table, specifically the schema that we just saw above.
10:36
Since we're all in one single conversation,
10:39
Claude should have no problem taking
10:40
a look at what the schema is.
10:42
We're specifying some requirements for this,
10:45
and just like in our existing skill,
10:46
we want to make sure that the reference
10:48
to our budget reallocation rules does not get modified.
10:52
Like we spoke about earlier, the skill creator skill
10:54
is extremely helpful and efficient,
10:56
but we still need to give the context necessary.
11:01
Notice here, the first thing it's going to do is analyze
11:03
the necessary skill structure and use our skill creator skill
11:07
to modify the existing skill
11:10
and follow best practices.
11:13
We're going to go ahead now and create the updated skill
11:17
with a new SKILL.md file.
11:20
Here we can start to see something
11:22
that feels similar to our previous skill.
11:25
But instead adding BigQuery instead of CSV uploads.
11:29
Under the hood, we're using the file system and bash tools
11:33
to create the necessary file and folder structure for us.
11:38
What we can see here is instead
11:40
of using a CSV, we're using BigQuery
11:43
and we're following the best practice of
11:45
using MCP servers with skills where we specify
11:48
the server and the name of the tool.
11:52
The skill-creator is following best practices
11:54
to take our existing skill and modify it.
11:58
So as we instructed skill-creator,
12:00
when we specified our required input.
12:02
We're seeing this in practice right now.
12:05
It's best practice not to use an ambiguous date range
12:08
or the entire range, so we ask the user to clarify,
12:11
and when we show an example
12:13
of querying, we're specifying a date range.
12:16
So some of the tools and requirements that we put in
12:19
are being directly applied when we update this skill.
12:22
So our skill looks like it's in great shape.
12:25
In order to make sure this is saved to subsequent conversations,
12:28
let's go ahead and copy this skill.
12:35
Now we're going to shift gears and
12:37
create a new skill for brand guidelines
12:38
that we'll use alongside this skill
12:42
to create a compelling data-driven PowerPoint presentation.
12:47
So let's go ahead and start with a new chat
12:49
and we're going to ask Claude to create
12:52
a brand guideline skill from files that we upload.
12:56
The first thing I'm going to do is upload a file
12:59
with my brand guidelines as well as some logos
13:02
to be used in the presentation.
13:05
Before we go ahead and create this skill,
13:07
let me just show you what these brand guidelines look like.
13:10
I've got a color palette, supporting colors, typography.
13:14
Claude knows how to design things, but where skills really shine
13:17
are where you can tell Claude exactly
13:20
how you want things done for your company.
13:22
logos, colors, fonts, great example.
13:26
Now let's go ahead and create a skill from these files
13:30
that we can apply to future presentations and documents.
13:33
What we're going to see here is the skill creator skill
13:37
in action again.
13:39
We're leveraging the existing tooling and skills that we have
13:42
to use best practices as well as the guideline and logos
13:46
to make a skill that is repeatable and portable.
13:50
We're going to analyze other existing
13:52
skills to see what patterns they use
13:54
and make sure that this new skill we're creating
13:57
can complement them. And this is extremely valuable
14:00
since we're going to be using this with PowerPoint presentations.
14:04
Now that we have a good
14:05
idea of what needs to be done,
14:07
let's run that init_skill Python script that we saw before.
14:11
This will create the underlying skill,
14:13
and now we can start adding our assets
14:15
to the skill's assets folder.
14:19
We're going to start to see colors populate,
14:22
accent colors, fonts, typography.
14:25
And in a bit, we'll have a skill
14:27
that we can start adding to all future conversations
14:29
when there's design that we need done.
14:33
Our logos are being pulled in,
14:35
Word documents and PDFs are specified,
14:37
and presentation layouts are the way that we want them to be.
14:41
The skill creator has finished running.
14:44
And here we have a SKILL.md file that's been created,
14:47
following best practices with a name and a description,
14:51
as well as underlying folders
14:53
with the necessary data and logos that we need.
14:56
There's one more step we need to do
14:58
to make sure that this gets added to future conversations.
15:02
In order to make sure this is saved to subsequent conversations,
15:06
let's go ahead and copy this skill.
15:10
Once this is done, we should see this skill
15:13
in the list of skills that we've created.
15:16
Now that we've updated
15:18
our skill to move from CSVs to BigQuery,
15:21
and created a new skill for our brand guidelines,
15:24
let's combine that to build a workflow alongside the built-in
15:27
PowerPoint presentation skill
15:30
to first analyze our data
15:32
and then generate a presentation.
15:34
So we're going to first analyze our marketing data
15:37
for a different week in BigQuery
15:39
to see how each channel is doing.
15:41
And then based on that data,
15:43
generate a presentation with our brand guidelines.
15:47
Let's see what this looks like.
15:49
First, we're going to go ahead and read the relevant skill files.
15:52
This includes our marketing campaign analysis
15:55
and will include our BigQuery guidelines as well.
15:59
We're going to go ahead and make
16:00
sure we have the correct PowerPoint presentation skill
16:02
as well as our brand skill for styling.
16:05
Inside of the underlying PowerPoint presentation skill,
16:08
there's additional documentation for presentation creation.
16:11
First, we're going to go ahead and start with BigQuery.
16:14
We're going to query what's necessary.
16:19
We can take a look and
16:21
see the underlying SQL that's being written
16:23
and like we saw before, that date range that we're looking for.
16:27
Now that we have the data,
16:29
we're going to use these metrics to go ahead
16:31
and generate a PowerPoint presentation.
16:33
We're going to do so with the styling that we've advised
16:36
in our brand style and turn this into a PowerPoint presentation.
16:39
can see here the underlying CSS and HTML
16:41
being written for our slides.
16:44
And then we're going to lean into the built-in skill
16:46
for creating the underlying presentation.
16:50
Now that we've got the right HTML files,
16:52
let's go ahead and create our presentation.
16:55
Here we're using the native PowerPoint skill
16:59
and writing the necessary code to create the presentation.
17:03
We can see here even when there
17:05
are particular issues, the model will go back
17:08
edit anything necessary
17:10
and lean on the exact workflow,
17:12
not only for running code necessary,
17:14
but validating what needs to be done.
17:17
This ability that the model has to backtrack
17:20
and follow particular patterns
17:21
allows for us to create presentations
17:24
that don't come with built-in issues
17:26
that we need to immediately then correct.
17:28
So we're seeing that Claude's done its verification, the slides look great.
17:32
Now it's going to go ahead and generate that underlying PowerPoint presentation,
17:36
which I can open up in
17:38
Google Drive and use as Google Slides,
17:40
or I can download directly.
17:42
We can see here, I've got some really nice looking slides
17:45
with the colors, fonts, logos,
17:48
and everything that I want for my particular company.
17:51
We have our efficiency analysis, funnel analysis,
17:54
and the executive summary that highlights what
17:56
needs review and what's doing quite well.
17:59
I can download this presentation, I
18:01
can continue to build off of it,
18:02
and again, open it up in Google Drive to share with teammates.
18:06
I can continue prompting and working with this presentation.
18:09
But what we're seeing here is an underlying PowerPoint presentation
18:12
created from a built-in skill,
18:14
combined with two skills that we've made
18:17
alongside an MCP server
18:19
pulling in data from BigQuery.
18:22
In the next lesson, we'll explore some of the best practices
18:25
around creating skills and take a look at two other custom skills
18:29
that we create and see if we're following the best practices.
